Tests pertaining to new user accounts are somewhat inconsistent at the moment. To avoid this, delete the Docker containers being tested, and rerun `docker-compose -f crypto-back/docker-compose-ci.yml up -d` before testing, to reset the database and ensure tests execute properly.

TODO:
Add tests for the following:
3. File Encryption and Decryption
4. File Upload Visibility
5. Testing Bug that You have fix and the Proposed Functionality/Feature (in Task II)
